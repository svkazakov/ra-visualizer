Genome read alignments visualizer

**ra-visualizer** is a Python script for visualizing genome reads and/or contigs alignments to reference.

It can generate the following pictures (in .svg format), with arbitrary zoom and offset, relative to the start 
of the reference:<br/>
Image with reads coloring:<br/>
<img src="pics/pic-useful-reads.jpg" alt="Image with useful reads coloring" width="450"> <br/>
<img src="pics/pic1.png" alt="Image 1" width="450"><br/>
<img src="pics/pic2.jpg" alt="Image 2" width="450"><br/>
<img src="pics/pic4.jpg" alt="Image 4" width="450"><br/>
Only contig mapping output:<br/>
<img src="pics/pic-contigs-mapping.jpg" alt="Image with contigs mapping" width="450"><br/>


Now the project is still a bit raw, but within a few months I will try to improve it.


## Future improvements

* Tidy up the code, add examples of its work.
* Add support for working directly with .sam files.
